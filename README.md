```

Add the following line:

```
<Puppet_Master_Private_IP> puppet
```

```
```
sudo dpkg -i puppet6-release-bionic.deb
```
```
sudo apt-get update
```
```
sudo apt-get install puppetserver -y
```
## Add changes
```

```
```
JAVA_ARGS = "-Xms512m -Xms512m"
```
### Allow traffic on port 8140

```
sudo ufw allow 8140
```

### Configure and start Puppet Master

```
sudo systemctl enable puppetserver.service
```
```
sudo systemctl start puppetserver.service
```

### Verify the version of Puppet Master

```
sudo systemctl status puppetserver.service
```

## Puppet Agent Setup

### Modify the Puppet Agent's hosts file

```
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```

Add the following line:

```
<Puppet_Master_Private_IP> puppet
```

### Download and install the Puppet Agent packages

```
curl -O https://apt.puppetlabs.com/puppet6-release-bionic.deb
```
```
sudo dpkg -i puppet6-release-bionic.deb
```
```
sudo apt-get update
```
```
sudo apt-get install puppet-agent -y
```

### Enable and restart the Puppet Agent service

```
sudo systemctl enable puppet
```
```
sudo systemctl restart puppet
```
```
sudo systemctl status puppet
```

## Signing Certificates on the Puppet Master

### List certificate requests

```
sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppetserver ca list
```

### Sign a specific certificate request

```
sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppetserver ca sign --certname <Agent_CertName>
```

## Applying Manifests on Puppet master

### Create a Puppet manifest file

```
sudo nano /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests/site.pp
```

Add content like the following example:

```
file { '/tmp/puppet_test.txt':
  ensure => present,
  mode   => '0644',
  content => "Hello from Puppet master (Welcome to puppet testing with vishal.) to agent on IP address ${ipaddress_eth0}\n",
}
```

### Trigger Puppet Agent to apply the changes (run on puppet Agent)

```
sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet agent --test
```

### Check the content of the test file (run on puppet Agent)

```
sudo cat /tmp/puppet_test.txt

```

Congratulations! Your Puppet Master and Puppet Agent are now set up and running. You've tested the configuration to ensure everything is working smoothly.

# script and instructions for setting up a Puppet manifest on the Master node and applying it on the Slave node. Here's a cleaned-up version of your instructions:

### Master Node:
## 1.Navigate to the Puppet directory:
```
cd /etc/puppetlabs
```
## 2.List the contents:
```
ls
```
## 3.Navigate to the code directory:
```
cd code
```
## 4.List the contents:
```
ls
```
## 5.Create the necessary directories:
```
sudo mkdir -p environments/production/manifests/
```
## 6.Create the necessary directories:
```
cd environments/production/manifests/
```
## 7.Create a new manifest file (`new_site.pp`):
```
sudo nano new_site.pp
```
## 8.Add the following content to the new_site.pp file:
```
node default {
    # 1st resource: Install Nginx
    package {'nginx':
        ensure => installed,
    }

    # 2nd resource: Create a status file
    file{ '/tmp/status.txt':
        content => 'Nginx has been installed successfully',
        mode    => '0644',
    }
}
```
## 9.Add the following content to the new_site.pp file:
### .Press Ctrl + X to exit.
### .Press Y to confirm saving.
### .Press Enter to save the file with the same name.

## Slave Node:
### 1.Apply the Puppet catalog:
```
sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet agent --test
```
## 2.Verify Nginx installation:
### .Copy the public IP of the slave node.
### .Open a web browser and paste the IP.
### .Hit `Enter` to check if it shows the Nginx default page.
## 3.Check the content of the status file:
```
cat /tmp/status.txt
```
### .On the slave node, run:
```
cat /tmp/status.txt
```
### .It should display: Nginx has been installed successfully.
### This should guide you through setting up your Puppet manifest and verifying its application on the slave node.

an example of a simple Puppet module that manages the installation and configuration of the Apache web server on a Linux system.

### On the Puppet Master Server

1. **Create the Module Directory Structure**:
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules/apache_example/{manifests,templates}
   ```

2. **Create the `init.pp` Manifest**:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules/apache_example/manifests/init.pp
   ```

   Add the following content:
   ```puppet
   class apache_example {
     package { 'apache2':
       ensure => 'installed',
     }

     service { 'apache2':
       ensure    => 'running',
       enable    => true,
       require   => Package['apache2'],
     }

     file { '/var/www/html/index.html':
       ensure  => 'file',
       content => template('apache_example/index.html.erb'),
       require => Package['apache2'],
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Create the `index.html.erb` Template**:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules/apache_example/templates/index.html.erb
   ```

   Add the following content:
   ```html
   <html>
   <head>
     <title>Welcome to Apache on <%= @hostname %></title>
   </head>
   <body>
     <h1>Hello from Puppet-managed Apache on <%= @hostname %>!</h1>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

4. **Edit the Site Manifest (`site.pp`)**:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests/site.pp
   ```

   Add the following node definition:
   ```puppet
   node 'your_slave_node_fqdn' {
     include apache_example
   }
   ```

   Replace `your_slave_node_fqdn` with the actual FQDN of your Puppet Agent (Slave) node.

### On the Puppet Agent (Slave) Server

1. **Run Puppet Agent to Apply Configuration**:
   After making changes on the Puppet Master, SSH into the Puppet Agent (Slave) node and run:

   ```bash
   sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet agent --test
   ```

   This command will:
   - Connect the agent to the Puppet Master.
   - Fetch the catalog that includes the `apache_example` module.
   - Apply the configuration, which includes installing Apache, starting the Apache service, and creating a custom `index.html` file.

### Verification

1. **Check the Apache Service**:
   Ensure that Apache is running on the Puppet Agent node:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status apache2
   ```

2. **Verify the Web Page**:
   Open a web browser and navigate to the IP address or domain of the Puppet Agent node (e.g., `http://<your_slave_node_ip>`). You should see the custom welcome page with the message "Hello from Puppet-managed Apache on [hostname]!".

### Summary of Commands

- **Master Server**:
  - Create directories: `sudo mkdir -p /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules/apache_example/{manifests,templates}`
  - Create and edit `init.pp`: `sudo nano /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules/apache_example/manifests/init.pp`
  - Create and edit template: `sudo nano /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules/apache_example/templates/index.html.erb`
  - Edit `site.pp`: `sudo nano /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests/site.pp`

- **Agent (Slave) Server**:
  - Run Puppet agent: `sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet agent --test`
